    "Description": "The all-India average indexed price of Internet expenses. This series is part of the new Consumer Price Index data set and has a weight of 0.08004% in the all India CPI Index. Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in the prices that consumers pay for goods and services that they consume. The CPI data is collected for a basket of goods and services, deemed to be representative of the consumption pattern of an average household in the base year. This series of CPI is with base year 2012 and is the most current and widely tracked series of CPI. In addition to an All-India series (which is this series), this Index is compiled separately for rural areas and urban areas.  The Index is composed of 299 items at an all-India level divided into 6 main groups - a) Food and Beverages, b) Pan, Supari and Intoxicants, c) Clothing and Footwear , d) Housing, e) Fuel and Light, and f) Miscellaneous. The weights of the 6 groups in the aggregate all-India CPI basket are: a) Food and Beverages 45.9% b) Pan, Tobacco and Intoxicants 2.4% c) Clothing and Footwear 6.5% d) Housing 10.1% e) Fuel and Light 6.8% f) Miscellaneous 28.3%. The Miscellaneous group, which mostly covers the services, is divided into 6 sub-groups. They are (the number is its weight in All-India Index):a) Household Goods and Services 3.8% b) Health 5.9% c) Transport and Communication 8.6% d) Recreation and Amusement 1.7% e) Education 4.5% f) Personal Care and Effects 3.9%. With the shift of monetary policy to an explicit inflation targeting framework with an explicit target for the CPI Inflation, the CPI data has become very important. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is tasked with keeping Inflation, as measured by the All India CPI Inflation under this 2012 series of CPI at around 4% over the medium-term.",

This series is part of the new Consumer Price Index data set and has a weight of 0.09756% in the all India CPI Index.

The CPI data is collected for a basket of goods and services, deemed to be representative of the consumption pattern of an average household in the base year. This series of CPI is with base year 2012 and is the most current and widely tracked series of CPI. In addition to an All-India series (which is this series), this Index is compiled separately for rural areas and urban areas.  The Index is composed of 299 items at an all-India level divided into 6 main groups - a) Food and Beverages, b) Pan, Supari and Intoxicants, c) Clothing and Footwear , d) Housing, e) Fuel and Light, and f) Miscellaneous. The weights of the 6 groups in the aggregate all-India CPI basket are: a) Food and Beverages 45.9% b) Pan, Tobacco and Intoxicants 2.4% c) Clothing and Footwear 6.5% d) Housing 10.1% e) Fuel and Light 6.8% f) Miscellaneous 28.3%.
